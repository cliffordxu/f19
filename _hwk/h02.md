Complete your reading of Chapter 1, section 1.3 pages 27-32, Chapter 2 sections 2.1 thru 2.4. Turn your homework in during lecture. 

<ol markdown="1">
1. (6 pts) The author describes the difference between "syntax errors" and "logic errors", and also the difference between syntax errors that produce an "error message" vs. those that produce a "warning message".  Briefly explain each of the items below in a way that makes the DIFFERENCES among them clear:
    <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

  i. Syntax errors that result in an error message:
    <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
  ii. Syntax errors that result in an warning message:
    <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
  iii. Logic errors:

    <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

2.	(2 pt) If the following statement were in a C++ program, what would it do?  
    <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em"></div>
cout >> "I love oranges and apples";

  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

3.	(2 pt) If the following statement were in a C++ program, what would it do?
  <div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>
cout << "The world goes round and round"
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
4.  (4 pts) Show 2 different ways to initialize variables in C++?
  <div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

5.  (2 pts) Is this variable declaration statement in C++ a good one? Why or why not?
<div markdown="1">
`double int=30;`
</div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>


6. (4 pts) Write an if-else statement that outputs the string "Grade is B" if the variable `score` is between 80 and 90 (both limits included). Otherwise the if-else statement should output "Grade is not B" ?
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>



7.  (5 pts) The program below intends to do the following: Repeatedly prompt the user to input an integer number. When the user no longer wants to continue entering numbers, output the sum of all the positive numbers entered by the user followed by the sum of all the negative numbers entered by the user. However, the given program has errors. Mark all logical and syntax errors in the program and provide corrections in the space provided to the right. Add missing statements if any.

<div markdown="1">
```
#include <iostream>

int main(){

    int a , sumPositive, sumNegative;

    string promptContinue ="\nTo continue enter Y/y\n";

    string promptNum = "\nEnter a number: ";

    char response;

    while (response = 'y'||`Y') {

       cout << promptNum;

       cin >> a;

       if(a)
          sumPositive+=a;

       else
          sumNegative+=a;

       cout<< promptContinue;



    }

    cout<< "Sum of all the positive numbers is: "<< sumPositive<<endl;

    cout<< "Sum of all the negative numbers is: "<< sumNegative<<endl;

    return 0;
}
```

<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>
